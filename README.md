# mohdAffancodes.github.io
My first repository 

# Mostly JS games
and a CLOCK website

I have some packages too made with 
# ELECTRON 
Namely a clock(analogue) deskstop app
&
An arcade classic BRICK_BREAKER deskstop app

# Which work across Windows,Mac & Linus

To see them live type this repository name/any one of my folders except soundWAV and favicons in a browser

For example
